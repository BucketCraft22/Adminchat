# Adminchat

Adminchat - A minecraft plugin for your admins on Velocity


## About

Adminchat is a simple Velocity plugin for Minecraft servers that allows administrators to privately message each other in-game. This allows them to hold private discussions on the server without the public seeing their messages. They can see in which server is the sender. This is a quick and handy plugin for a single, small server.

Adminchat was created by BucketCraft.
You can find me on discord by the username: **bucketcraft**
